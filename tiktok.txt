Transcript:
(00:00) it's very nice to have you here let's see first of all you know congratulations you really 
put off something remarkable on on that grilling you achieved something that very few 
people do which was you pulled off a kind of a bipartisan consensus in U.S politics was great 
you know the bad news was that that consensus largely seemed to be we must ban tick tock 
so we're going to come to that in a bit and I'm curious about but before we before we go 
there we need to know about you um you you seem to me like a remarkable
(00:33) person I want to know a bit of your story and how you came to tick tock in the in the 
first place okay thank you Chris before we do that can I just check I need to know my audience 
how many of you here use tick tock just oh thank you for those who don't the Wi-Fi is free 
so that's another question which is how many of you here have had your lives touched 
through Tick Tock through your kids and other people in your lives I mean it's oh that's great 
to see it it's basically if you're alive you have
(01:04) had some kind of contact with with Tick Tock at this point Thank you tell us about you 
so my name is show and I'm from Singapore roughly 10 years ago I met with two Engineers 
who were building a product and the idea behind this was to build a product that 
recommended content to people not based on who they knew which was uh if you think 
about it 10 years ago it was all the social graph was all in the rage and the idea was you know 
your content and the fee that you saw should be based on people that you knew you know 
about 10
(01:38) years ago these two Engineers thought about something different which is instead of 
showing you what you what you know instead of showing you people you knew why don't 
we show you content that you liked and that's sort of the Genesis and the birth of um you 
know the early iterations of tick tock and about five years ago with the Advent of um you 
know 4G short video mobile phone penetration Tick Tock was born and a couple of years ago 
you know I had the opportunity to run this company and it still excites me
(02:08) every single day so I want to dig in a little more into this about what was it that made 
this takeoff so explicit because the the language I hear from people who you know spent time 
on it it's sort of like I mean it it is a different level of addiction to other uh media out there 
and I don't necessarily mean this in a good way we'll be coming on to it there's good and 
bad things about this type of addiction but it's the feeling that within a couple days of of uh 
experience of tick tock it knows you and
(02:38) it and it surprises you with things that you didn't know you were going to be interested 
in but you are how is it really just instead of the social graph what are these algorithms doing 
the I think to describe this uh to begin to answer your question we have to talk about the 
mission of the company now the mission is to inspire creativity and to bring joy and I think 
you know missions for companies like ours is really important because you have product 
managers working on the product every single day and they need to have a
(03:09) North star you know something to sort of work towards together now based on this 
Mission our vision is to provide three things to our users we want to provide a window to 
discover and I'll talk about Discovery you talked about this in a second we want to give them 
a canvas to create which is going to be really exciting with new technologies in AI that's going 
to help people you know help people create new things and the final thing is bridges for 
people to connect so that's sort of the vision of what
(03:37) we're trying to build now what really makes Tick Tock very unique and very different 
is the whole discovery engine behind us so there are earlier apps that I have a lot of respect 
for but they were built for a different purpose you know for example in the era of search you 
know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was so 
that it's more easily found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people 
and their followers now what we have done is that
(04:07) we are based on our machine learning algorithms we're showing people what they 
like and what this means is that we have given the everyday person a platform to be 
discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on Tick Tock and I'll just 
give you one one example of this the biggest Creator on Tick Tock is a guy called kabi cubby 
was from Senegal he lives in Italy he was a factory worker um he you know for the longest 
time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was you know he had
(04:39) Talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so he kept posting 
and today he has 160 million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories 
like that you know businesses people with talent and I think it's very it's very freeing to have 
a platform where as long as you have talent you're going to be hurt and you have the chance 
to succeed and that's what we're providing to our users so this is this is the amazing thing to 
me like we've most of us have grown
(05:07) grown up with say Network television for where for decades you've had thousands of 
brilliant creative people toiling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for 
an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that looked like many 
of your creators so so the these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior and what 
they look like have discovered things that thousands of brilliant humans never discovered tell 
me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things
(05:41) like if someone presses like or stays on a video for a long time that gives you a clue 
more like that but is it subject matter what what what are the what are the array of things that 
you have noticed that you can actually track that that provide useful Clues the I'm going to 
simplify this a lot but the machine learning the recommendation algorithm is really just math 
so for example if you if you like videos one two three and four and I like videos one two three 
and five maybe he liked videos one two three
(06:11) and six now what's going to happen is because we like one two three at the same 
time he's going to be shown four five six and so are we and you can think about this repeated 
at scale in real time across more than a billion people that's basically what it is is math and of 
course you know it Ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big 
scale and what we have seen the result of this is that they learned the interest signals that 
people exhibit very quickly and shows you content that's really relevant for you
(06:41) in a very in a very quick way now so it's a form of collaborative filtering from what 
you're saying that the theory behind it is that these humans are weird people we don't really 
know what they're interested in but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap 
of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that 
are in that overlapped humans repertoire to to to feed to feed them and they'll be surprised 
but the reason they like it is because their power also
(07:09) liked it it is pattern recognition based on your interest signals and I think the other 
thing here is that we don't actually ask you 20 questions on whether you like a piece of content 
you know what are your interests we don't do that we build that experience organically into 
the app experience so you are voting with your thumbs you know by watching a video you 
know by swiping it by liking it by sharing it you are basically exhibiting interest signals and 
what it does mathematically is to take those signals put it in a formula
(07:39) and then matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the idea behind it I 
mean lots of startups have tried to use these these types of techniques I'm wondering what 
else played a role early on I mean how big a deal was it that from the get-go you were 
optimizing for smartphones so that videos were shot in portrait format and they and they 
were short was that was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered I think we were the 
first to really try this at scale um you know the recommendation algorithm
(08:09) is a very important reason as to why the the platform is so popular among so many 
people but beyond that you know you mentioned um the format itself so we talked about 
the vision of the company which is to have a window to discover and if you sort of just open 
that for the first time you see that it takes up your whole screen so that's the window that we 
want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives 
then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found
(08:39) that it connects people together people find communities and I've heard so many 
stories of people who have found their communities because of the content that they're 
posting now I'll give you an example I was in DC recently and I met with a bunch of creators 
I heard yes and uh so one of them was sitting next to me at the dinner his name is Samuel he 
runs a restaurant in Phoenix Arizona and it's a taco restaurant he told me he has never done 
this before first you know venture he started posting all this content on
(09:10) Tick Tock and you know I saw his content it looks I was hungry after looking at it it's 
just great you know content and he's generated so much interest in his business the last year 
he made something like a million dollars in Revenue just via Tick Tock One restaurant and 
again and again I hear these stories you know by connecting people together by giving 
people the window to discover we have given many small businesses and many people your 
common person a voice that they will never otherwise have and I
(09:39) think that's the power of the platform so you definitely have identified early just how 
you know we're social creatures we need affirmation I've heard a story and you can tell me 
whether true or not that one of the keys to your early liftoff was that you wanted to persuade 
creators who were trying out Tick Tock that this was a platform where you know they would 
get response early on when you're trying to grow something the numbers aren't there for 
response so you had the brilliant idea of goosing those
(10:09) numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a bigger sense of like 
more likes more engagement than was actually the case by using AI agents somehow in the 
in the process is that a brilliant idea or is that or is that just a myth I I would uh I would I would 
describe it in a different way so there are other platforms that exist you know before Tick Tock 
and if you think about those platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to get 
followers because the way it's built is that
(10:38) people come and follow people and if you don't if you are not really famous the 
chances that you get discovered are very very low now what we have done again because of 
the difference in the way we're recommending content is that we've given anyone any single 
person with enough Talent a stage to be able to be discovered and I think that actually is the 
single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and 
again and again you will hear stories from people who use the
(11:05) platform who post regularly on it that if they have something they want to say the 
platform gives them the chance and the stage to connect with their audience in a way that I 
think no other product in the past has ever offered them so I'm just trying to play back what 
what use what you said there you said you were describing a different way what I what I said 
is is it then the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but 
doesn't come with any followers initially that you you have you've got
(11:34) some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them 
you will you will give them some kind of um uh you know artificially increase the number of 
followers or likes or whatever that they have so that others are encouraged to go wow there's 
something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur 
every party planner kind of knows about of no no this is the hot place in town everyone come 
and that is how you actually gain critical mass
(11:58) we want to make sure that um every person who posts a video is given an an equal 
chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are maybe 
alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that but can 
you get could you get AI agents to like something could you see the network work with extra 
AI agents that could kind of you know give someone early encouragement ultimately what 
the machine does is it recognizes people's interests so if you post something
(12:30) that's not interesting to a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not 
going to get the virality that you want whereas so it's a lot of you know there is no uh there's 
no push here you know it's not like you can go and push something because I like Chris you 
know I'm going to push your content and it doesn't work like that you got to have a message 
that resonates with people and if it does then it will automatically just have the virality itself 
that's the beauty of user
(12:56) generator content it's it's not something that can be engineered or over thought you 
know it really is something that has to resonate with the audience and if it does then it goes 
viral I'm not speaking privately with an investor who knows your company quite quite well um 
who who said that actually the the the level of sophistication of the algorithms you have going 
is is just another order of magnitude to what competitors like you know Facebook or YouTube 
have going um is that is that just hypo or do you
(13:26) do you really believe you like how complex are these algorithms well I think in terms 
of complexity there are many companies with a lot of resources and a lot of talent you know 
they will figure out the even the complex the most complex algorithms I think what is very 
different is your mission of your company how you started the company like I said you know 
we started with this idea that this was the main use case the most important use case is you 
come and you get to see recommended content now for some other
(13:56) apps out there they are very significant and have a lot of users they're built for a 
different original purpose and if you're built for something different then your users are used 
to that because the community comes in and they expect that sort of experience so I think 
the pivot away from that it's not it's not really just a matter of engineering and algorithms it's 
a matter of what your company is built to begin with which is why I started this by saying you 
need to have a vision you need to have a mission
(14:22) and that's the North Star where you you can't just shift it halfway right and is it fair to 
say that because your start Point has been interest algorithms rather than social off algorithms 
you've been able to avoid some of the worst of the sort of the filter bubbles that have 
happened in other social media where you have tribes kind of declaring warning each other 
effectively and and so much of the noise and and energy is is around that do you believe that 
you've largely avoided that on on Tick Tock the
(14:49) diversity of content that our users see is very key you know to in order for the discovery 
and the mission is to discover so sorry the vision is to discover so in order to facilitate that it 
is very important to us that what the users see is the diversity of content um now generally 
speaking you know there are certain issues that you mentioned that the industry faces you 
know there are some bad actors who come on the internet they post bad content you know 
our approach is that we have very clear Community guidelines we're very
(15:21) transparent about what is allowed and what is not allowed on our platform no 
Executives make any ad hoc decisions and based on that we have built a team that is tens of 
thousands of people plus machines in order to identify content that is bad and actively and 
proactively remove it from the platform talk about what some of those key guidelines are we 
have it published on our website um we just in March we just um iterated a new version to 
make it more readable so there are many things like for example no pornography clearly no 
child sexual
(15:55) abuse material and and other bad things no violence for example we also make it 
clear that there's a differentiated experience if you're below 18 years old so if you're below 
18 years so for example your entire app experience is actually more restricted we don't allow 
as an example users below 16 by default to go viral we don't allow that if you're below 16 we 
don't allow you to use and the instant messaging feature in app if you're below 18 we don't 
allow you to use the live
(16:25) streaming features and of course we give parents a whole set of tools to control their 
teenagers experience as well but how do you how do you know the age of your users in our 
industry we do we rely mainly on something called age gating which is when you sign up for 
the app for the first time and we ask you for the age now beyond that we also have we also 
have built tools to go through your public profile for example when you post a video we try 
and match what the age that you said with the video that you just posted now there are 
questions of
(16:56) can we do more and that question is always has for every company by the way in our 
industry has to be balanced with privacy now if you know for example you know we scan the 
faces of every single user then I you know we will significantly increase the ability to tell their 
age but we will also significantly increase the amount of data that we collect on you now we 
don't want to collect data we don't want to scan data on your face to collect that so that 
balance has to be maintained and it's a challenge that we are working
(17:25) through together with you know industry together with The Regulators as well so look 
one thing that is is unquestionable is that you have created a platform for literally millions of 
people who never thought they were going to be a content creator you've given them an 
audience I'd actually like to hear from you one other favorite example of someone who Tick 
Tock has given an audience to that never had that before I think um you know so when again 
you know when I meet with when I travel around the world I meet it for a whole bunch of
(17:53) creators on our platform I was in South Korea just yesterday and before that you know 
I met with um before that I met with a bunch of people don't expect for example teachers 
there is a English teacher from Arkansas my name is Claudine and I met her in person she 
uses her platform to reach out to students you know there is another teacher called chemical 
kin and chemical Kim teaches chemistry what she does is she uses our platform to reach out 
to a much broader student based than she has in her classroom and they're both very very
(18:28) popular you know in fact what we have realized is that stem content has over 116 
billion views on our platform globally and is so significant in a year cumulative 160 billion is 
so significant that in the US we have started testing creating a feed just for stem content just 
for stamp content I've been using it for a while and I learned something new you want to 
know what it is apparently if you flip an egg you know on your tray the egg will last longer 
it's signs there's a whole video on this you know I learned this on Tech talk you
(19:06) can search for this you want to know something else about an egg if you put it in just 
one hand and squeeze it as hard as you can it will never break yes I think I read about that 
too it's not somewhere we can search for it but look here's the flip side to all this amazingness 
and it's really it's honestly this is the key thing that I I want to have a an honest conversation 
with you because it's such an important issue this question of human addiction you know we 
are animals with a prefrontal cortex
(19:42) that's how I think of us we have these addictive instincts that that go back millions of 
years and and and we often are in the mode of trying to modulate our own you know Behavior 
it turns out that the internet is incredibly good at activating our animal cells and getting them 
so damn excited and and your company the company you've built is better at it than any 
other company on the planet I think so what are the risks of this I mean how from from a 
company point of view for example it's in your interest to have
(20:22) people on there as long as possible so some would say is the first pass you want 
people to be addicted as long as possible that's how advertising money will flow and so forth 
and that's how your creators will be delighted what is too much I don't actually agree with 
that I you know as a company our goal is not to optimize and maximize time spent it is not 
in fact in order to address people spending too much time on our platform we have done a 
number of things I was just speaking with uh some of your
(20:54) colleagues backstage one of them Tony you know she has encountered this as well if 
you spend too much time on our platform we will proactively send you videos to tell you to 
get off the platform we also we will and depending on the time of the day if it's late at night 
it will come sooner we have also building tools the limit if you below 18 years old by default 
we set a 16 minute default time limit how many 60 Minutes six hours and we've given parents 
tools and yourself tools if you go to settings you can set your own time limit we've
(21:25) given parents tools so that you can pair if for the parents who don't know this go to 
settings family pairing you can pair your phone with your teenager's phone and set the time 
limit and we really encourage parents to have these conversations with their teenagers or 
what is the right amount of screen time I think there's a healthy relationship that you should 
have with your screen and as a business you know we believe that that balance needs to be
met so it's not true that we just want to maximize a time span if you if you were
(21:52) advising parents here what time they should actually recommend to their teenagers 
what do you think is the right setting well 60 minutes we did not come up with it ourselves 
so I went to the digital Wellness Lab at the Boston Children's Hospital and you know we had 
this conversation with them and 16 minutes was the recommendation that they gave to us 
which is why we built this into the app now so 60 Minutes ticket for what it is you know it's 
something that you know we've had some discussions of experts
(22:16) but I think for all parents here it is very important to have these conversations with 
your teenage children and you know help them help them develop a healthy relationship with 
screens I think we live in an age where it's completely inevitable that we're going to interact 
with screens and you know digital content but I I think we should develop healthy habits early 
on in life and that's something I would encourage I'm curious to ask the audience um of um 
which of you have ever had that video on Tick Tock appear
(22:46) saying come on I mean okay so maybe a third of the audience seem to be active tiptock users and about 20 people maybe put their hands up there so it's it are you sure that 
like it feels to me like this this is a great this is a great thing to have and um but are you isn't 
there always going to be a Temptation in any given quarter or whatever to just push it a bit 
at the boundary and just dial back a bit on that so that you can hit Revenue goals etc etc is it 
is it are you saying that this is used scrupulously I I think um
(23:24) you know in terms even if you think about it from a commercial point of view it is 
always best when your customers have a very healthy relationship with your product it's 
always best when it's healthy so if you think about very short-term retention maybe but I 
don't think that's not the way we think about it if you think about it from a longer term 
perspective what you really want to have is a healthy relationship you know you don't want 
people to be you know to develop with very unhealthy habits and
(23:49) then at some point they're going to drop it right no so I think everything in moderation 
there's a there's a claim out there that um in China there's a much more rigorous standards 
imposed on the amount of time that children especially can spend on the um you know that 
is uh unfortunately a a very um it's a misconception so that experience that is being 
mentioned for tawin which is a different app is for an under 14 year old experience now if you 
compare that in the United States we have under 13 experience in the US it's
(24:24) only available in the US it's not available here in Canada in Canada we just don't allow 
it if you look at the under 13 experience in the U.S it's much more restricted than the under 
14 experience in China it's so restrictive that every single piece of content is vetted by our 
third party child safety expert and we don't allow any under 13s in the U.
(24:49) S to publish we don't allow them to post and we don't allow them to use a lot of 
features so I think that that report I've seen that report too it's not doing a fair comparison 
what do you make of this issue you know in a lot of your you've got these millions of content 
creators and all of them in a sense are in a race for attention and that race can pull them in 
certain directions so for example um teenage girls on Tick Tock sometimes people worry that 
that to win attention they've discovered that by being more sexual that they can gain extra 
viewers
(25:20) does is this a concern is there anything you can do about this we address this in our 
community guidelines as well um you know if you look at sort of the sexualized content on 
our guidelines if you're below a certain age you know for certain team themes that are mature 
we actually remove that from your experience again I come back to this you know we want 
to have a safe platform in fact at my congressional hearing I mean four commitments to our
users and to the politicians in the US and one of the first one is that we take safety
(25:51) especially for teenagers extremely seriously and we will continue to prioritize that you 
know I believe that we need to give our teenage users and our users in general a very safe 
experience because if we don't do that then we cannot the mission is to inspire creativity and 
to bring joy right if they don't feel safe I can not fulfill my mission so it's all very organic to 
me as a business to make sure I do that but in the strange interacting world of human 
psychology and so forth weird memes can take off I mean you had this
(26:22) outbreak a couple years back of these devious licks where kids were competing with 
each other to do vandalism in schools and you know get lots of followers from it how on 
Earth do you battle something like that um so dangerous challenges are not allowed on our 
platform it's uh if you look at our guidelines we it's violative we proactively invest resources 
to identify them and remove them from our platform in fact if you search for Dangerous 
challenges on our platform today we will redirect you to a safety
(26:50) resource page and we actually worked with some creators as well to come up with 
campaigns and this is another campaign it's the stop think decide before you add campaign 
where we work with the creators to produce videos to explain to people that some of things 
are dangerous please don't do it and we post those videos actively on our on our platform 
as well that's cool and you've got you've got lots of employees I mean how many employees 
do you have who are specifically looking at these content
(27:18) moderation things or is that the wrong question is it are they mostly identified by AI 
initially and then and then you have a group who are overseeing and making the final decision 
um the group is based in Ireland um and um it's a lot of people it's tens of thousands of 
people tens of tens of thousands it's a huge it's one of the most important cost items of my 
P L and I think it's completely worth it now most of the moderation has to be done by 
machines the machines are good they're
(27:45) quite good but they're not as good as you know they're not perfect at this point so 
you have to complement them with a lot of human beings today and I think by the way a lot 
of the progress in AI in general is making that kind of content moderation capabilities a lot 
better so we're gonna get more precise you know we're going to get more specific and it's 
going to get you know is going to be able to handle larger scale and that's something I think 
you know that I'm personally looking forward to
(28:14) what about this perceived huge downside of use of certainly Instagram I think Tick 
Tock as well where people worry that you are amplifying insecurities especially of of teenagers 
and perhaps especially teenage girls that you see they see these amazing people on there 
doing amazing things they feel inadequate there's all these reported cases of of depression 
insecurity suicide and so forth I I take this extremely seriously um so again in our guidelines 
for certain themes that we think are mature um and not suitable for teenagers we
(28:51) actually proactively remove it from their experience um at the same time if you search 
certain terms we will make sure that you get redirected to a resource safety page now we're 
always working with experts to understand some of these new trends that could emerge and 
proactively try to manage and try to manage them if that makes sense now this is a problem 
that predates us the predates tick tock it actually predates the internet you know it's um but 
it's our responsibility to make sure that we invest enough to
(29:20) understand and to address the concerns to keep the experience as safe as possible 
for as many people as possible now in Congress the the main concern seem to be not so 
much what we've talked about but um data the data of users the fact that you're owned by 
bite dance Chinese company and the concern that at any moment um Chinese government 
might require or ask for data and in fact there have been instances where I think you've you've 
confirmed that that some data of journalists on the platform was was made
(29:52) available to bite dancers engineers and from the who who knows what now your your 
response to this was to have this you know project Texas where you're moving data to be 
controlled by Oracle here in the US can you can you can you talk about that project and and 
why if you believe it so why we should not worry so much about this issue I will say a couple 
of things about this if you don't mind the first thing I would say is that the internet is built on 
global interoperability and we are not the only company that relies on a global talent
(30:24) pool to make our products as good as technology is a very collaborative effort you 
know I think many people here would say the same thing so we are not the first company to 
have engineers in all countries including in China we're not the first one now I understand 
some of these concerns so you know the data access by employees is not data accessed by 
government this is very different and there's a clear difference in this but we hear the concerns 
that are raised in the United States we did not try to avoid you know
(30:54) discussing or we did not try to argue our way out of it what we did was we built an 
unprecedented project where we localized American data to be stored on American soil by 
an American company overseen by American Personnel so this this kind of protection firm 
for American data is beyond what any other company in our industry has ever done it's well 
money is not the only issue here but it's very expensive to build something like that and more 
importantly you know we are basically localizing data in a way that no other
(31:28) company has done so we need to be very careful that whilst we are pursuing data 
what we call digital sovereignty in the us and we're also doing a version of this in Europe that 
we don't balkanize the internet now we are the first to do it and I expect that you know other 
companies are probably looking at this and trying to figure out how you balance between 
protecting protected data you know to make sure that everybody feels secure about it while 
at the same time allowing for interoperability to continue to happen because that's what
(31:57) makes technology and the internet so great that's something that we are how far are 
you along that Journey with project Texas we are very very far along today when when when 
will there be a clear you know here it is it's done as far well this data is protected today by 
default all new U.S data is already stored in the Oracle Cloud infrastructure so it's in this 
protected U.
(32:21) S environment that we talked about in the United States we still have some Legacy 
data to delay eat in our own service in Virginia and in Singapore our data has never been 
stored in China by the way that deletion is a very big engineering effort so as we said as I said 
that the hearing is going to take me it's going to take us a while to delete them but I expect 
it to be done this year foreign how much power do you have over your own ability to control 
certain things so for for example suppose that for whatever reason the Chinese government 
was to look at an
(32:55) upcoming U.S election and say you know what we would like this party to win let's say 
or we would like Civil War to break out or whatever how and we could do this by amplifying 
the content of certain troublemaking disturbing people causing uncertainty spreading this 
information Etc how you were required via bite dance to do this like first of all is there is there 
a pathway where theoretically that's possible um what what do you what's your personal Line 
in the Sand on on this so the during the Congressional hearing I made
(33:33) four commitments uh we talked about the first one which is safety the third one is to 
keep Tick Tock a place of freedom of expression by the way if you go on Tick Tock today you 
can search for anything you want as long as it doesn't violate our community guidelines and 
to keep it free from any government manipulation and the fourth one is transparency and 
third-party monitoring so the way we are trying to address this concern is an unprecedented 
amount of transparency what do I mean by this we're actually allowing third-party
(34:02) reviewers to come in and review our source code I don't know any other company 
that does this by the way um just so because everything as you know is driven by code so to 
allow someone else to review the source code is to give this a significant amount of 
transparency to ensure that the design areas that you described there's Kylie hypothetical 
cannot happen on our platform now at the same time we are releasing more research tools 
for researchers so that they can study the output so you know the source code is
(34:31) the input we are also allowing researchers to study the output which is the content on 
our platform I think the easiest way to sort of defend this office is transparency you know we 
give people access to to monitor us and we can just make it very very transparent and that's 
our approach to the problem so you will say directly to this group that the scenario I talked 
about of Chinese theoretical Chinese government in interference in an American election you 
can say that will not happen I can say that we are building all the
(35:02) tools to to prevent any of these actions from happening um and I'm very confident 
that with an unprecedented amount of transparency that we're giving on the platform we can 
hide we can reduce this risk to as low as zero as possible to a slow a zero as possible to as 
close to zero as possible as close to zero as possible that's fairly reassuring fairly um I mean 
how would the world know and what would like if you discovered this or you thought you 
had to do it is this is this a align in the sand for you like are you
(35:42) at a situate you would not let the company that you know now and that you are 
running do this absolutely that's the reason why we're letting third parties monitor them 
because if they find out you know yeah they will disclose this we also have transparency 
reports by the way where we talked about talk about a whole bunch of things the content 
that we remove you know that violates our guidelines government requests you know it's all 
published online all you have to do is search for it so you're super compelling and
(36:07) likable as a CEO I have to say and I I would like to as we wrap this up I'd like to give 
you a chance just to paint like what's the vision what as you look at what Tick Tock could be 
let's let's move the clock out say five five years from now what what how should we think 
about your contribution to our Collective future I think it's still down to division that we have 
so in terms of the window of Discovery I think there's a huge benefit to the world when people 
can discover new things you know
(36:37) people think that Tick Tock is all about dancing and singing and there's nothing wrong 
with that because it's super fun there's still a lot of that but we're seeing science content stem 
content listening have you heard about book talk it's a it's a viral Trend that talks about books 
and encourages people to read that book talk has 120 billion views globally 120 billion billion 
with a B people are learning how to cook people are learning people are learning about 
science people are learning how to
(37:04) golf well people are watching videos on golfing I guess I haven't gotten better and I 
think there's a huge opportunity here on Discovery and giving the everyday person a voice if 
you talk to our creators you know a lot of people will tell you this again and again that before 
Tick Tock they they would never have been discovered and we have given them the platform 
to do that it's important to maintain that we talk about creation you know there's all these 
new technology coming in with with AI generative content that allows that will
(37:38) help people create even more creative content I think there's going to be a 
collaboration between and I think there's a speaker who's going to talk about this within 
people in AI where they can unleash their creativity in a different way you know like for 
example I'm terrible at drawing personally but if if I had somebody I had to help me then 
maybe I can express myself even better then we talk about bridges to connect and connecting 
people in the communities together this could be products this could be
(38:04) Commerce five million small business 5 million businesses in the US benefit from Tick 
Tock today I think we can get that number to a much higher number and of course if you 
look around the world including in Canada that number is going to be massive so I think 
these are the biggest opportunities that we have and it's it's really very exciting so courtesy 
of of your experience in Congress you actually became a bit of a Tick-Tock star yourself I 
think um some of your videos have gone viral how about you've got your phone with you
(38:33) little Tick Tock video right now if the audience doesn't do this if you don't mind we're 
just going to do a selfie together how's that okay so why don't we just say hi hi hello from 
Ted all right thank you I hope it goes viral if that one goes viral I think I've given up on your 
algorithm actually I think it's gonna it's gonna take better um you're one of the most influential 
and powerful people in the world whether you know it or not and I really appreciate you 
coming and sharing your vision I
(39:09) really really hope the upside of what you're talking about comes about thank you so 
much thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
